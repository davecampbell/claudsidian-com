Welcome to Claudsidian - where we explore the powerful combination of Claude Code and Obsidian to create an AI-enhanced second brain.

## Why Claudsidian?

I discovered this workflow after hearing about it on a podcast. The idea was simple but transformative: use Claude Code directly within your Obsidian vault to get AI assistance while building your knowledge base.

After experimenting with this setup, I realized something remarkable was happening:

- **Complex projects became manageable** - Claude helped break down and track intricate multi-step workflows
- **Knowledge connections emerged** - The AI helped me see patterns and links I would have missed
- **Documentation happened naturally** - Conversations with Claude became permanent notes in my vault
- **My second brain got smarter** - The combination was more powerful than either tool alone
